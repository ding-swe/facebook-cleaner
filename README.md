# basketbase: Modern Fantasy Analytics

## Overview 

_*basketbase*_ is a MERN (MongoDB, ExpressJS, React, NodeJS) stack project built to dive deeper into NBA basketball statistics to better inform fantasy basketball decisions. Visualize and easily identfiy trends in player performances, as well as predict future performances based on team matchup, player matchup, and other factors. Create custom lists to display on your dashboard and manipulate custom charts. Automate the eye tests you run every night and see what's really going on with the bigger picture. 


## Design
This project was built using the MERN stack to learn and explore each of its components. Each element is known for being able to start your project up very fast and see immediate results developing the project, as well has having an active community supporting the tech and answering questions. 

MongoDB was always a technology that I wanted to try, and with Atlas, getting started seemed very easy. NoSQL was a must, as I had only worked with relational databases and *they* say non-relational lets you be more flexible in how you query your data. 

To acquire this data and load it into MongoDB, I'll have to write a script job (TBD, Python) that runs every night and collects the nightly game data from the NBA API. There'll have to be 2 scripts, the initial script that loads all historical data, and the nightly one that'll collect today's games and store each player's individual performance as well as other analytics to better inform predictions and trends. 

For the UI design, I chose to use figma.com because of its easy to use, intuitive interface. I could start mocking up designs very easily without having to invest too much time into figuring out how to do the simple things. Choosing the colors for the UI involved shuffling coolors.io repeatdly until the layout gave off a pleasant comfortable glow while also implying a confident, facts-based environment.  

The name itself was inspired  by namelix.com. I liked it because it hinted at the basketball subject matter conjoined with the eventual comprehensive database of relevant NBA basketball statistics and analytics, hence, *basketbase*.
